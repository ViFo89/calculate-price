# Price calculator
This is what I did in 2 hours. I have some stuff that I would like to have done better.


**Move Date dependency**

I consider it to be bad practice to be dependant on the `Date` directly. I would rather have injected the dependency in some form to provide the specific date that is required for the calculation.
